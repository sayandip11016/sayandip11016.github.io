I am Sayandip Dhara, a scientist with a background in physics and machine learning. I earned my PhD in Physics from the University of Central Florida, where I focused on quantum information and condensed matter physics. My research interests include quantum many-body physics, quantum coherence, and the application of machine learning to quantum systems.
I have held a post-doctoral research position at New York University, where I worked on dual-unitary quantum circuits and the Floquet Transverse Field Ising Model. Additionally, I have experience leading theoretical and numerical studies of Josephson junctions for terahertz radiation detection at Truventic LLC.
My work has been published in several scientific journals, and I have presented my research at various conferences. I am proficient in programming languages such as Python and Fortran and have experience with quantum simulation tools like CIRQ, Qiskit, and Itensor.
Feel free to explore my publications and research projects to learn more about my work in the field of quantum physics. This introduction maintains a professional and reserved tone while providing essential information about your background and expertise.
